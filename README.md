# This is the Rubic Cube solver.

### • Rule-based Rubik’s Cube solver (C++)

### • Focus on first-layer solving

### • Engine designed to be UI-independent

### • Planned OpenGL desktop visualizer

### • Planned web-based learning interface

#### That’s it. No essays.

## Color code for the rubicks cube side.

#### we let :

1 --> White  
2 --> Orange  
3 --> Yellow  
4 --> Red  
5 --> Green  
6 --> Blue

**Cube.h** : This defines How the cube is represented. What operations are possible on a cube.

This is what a Rubik's Cube looks like in Code.

`Latter we will make a real our own rubic cube learning platform, where you can practice and learn to solve a cube without spending money to buy real cube.`
